# The Geography Game

Tw o or more people can play the geography game. The first person says the name of a
city (in any country in the world). The next person must say the name of a city that starts with the last letter of the previous city name. No city can be used more than once. If you can’t think of a city name, you’re out (and the last person in wins).

**Design Considerations**
(1) Given the name of a file containing city names, one per line, read all names into
this Geog object’s ArrayList.
(2) Print all of the names in this Geog object’s ArrayList.
(3) Check whether one name is the same as another name backwards.
(4) Remove a giv en name from this Geog object’s ArrayList (if it is there).
(5) Check whether the first letter in a name is a vowel.
(6) Find the longest name in this Geog object’s ArrayList.
(7) Read a name typed in by the user of the program.
(8) Check whether the last letter of one name is the same as the first letter of another
name.
(9) Check whether two names have the same length.
(10) Find a name in this Geog object’s ArrayList that starts with a given letter.
(11) Find a name in this Geog object’s ArrayList that ends with a given letter.
